        <p class=head>What I did </p>
        <hr class=divider>
        <p class=light>– In July of 2016 I spent two weeks in Manhatten doing an internship with Sansi Corporation, makers of LED boards used in Times Square and in large stadiums around the world. My time was divided between a live construction site installing a 138’
            tall LED board 10 stories up on 7th avenue, and working in their corporate offices on various projects.
            <p>My role at the construction site was to document, with photos and text all that occurred. I was typically on site for 4-5 hours each morning
            starting at 5 AM so I was able to see and document a great deal of activity. My report was published on line and read by architects, project managers, owners and contractors. One of my many takeaways was how well the planners and contractors
            worked with the crane operators to ensure not only safe movement of very large board sections, but that this was happening in times square with little or no impact on traffic.
            <p>While in the office, I was asked to work on several projects. My
            first task was to redesign how the individual LED sections (many small sections plug into a board to create a very large image) attach to the board, allowing 4 keyholes to actuate 8 different locations. I was able to improve on
            the design and created a system to use just 2 keyholes to actuate 6 locations.
            <p>The next assignment was to reorganize their office space to expand work stations from 11 to 15 people in very limited space. I was able to provide a drawing with
            my suggestion that accomplished the task. My last project was to interface a PlayStation into their computer system that would allow them to demonstrate the interface with live boards for client presentations. I successfully created the interface
            and suddenly realized I actually had live control of one of their boards already in Times Square….a very brief feeling of incredible power came over me but I resisted the temptation to say hello to NY from Alex.
