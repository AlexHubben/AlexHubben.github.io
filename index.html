                <p class=light>  Brief Personal Statement – Hi. I’m Alex Hubben, graduating senior at Lake Norman High School in Mooresville, NC and welcome to my website.  I built this to share a little bit of information about myself, but also quite frankly, because I like building things and this as a great opportunity to teach myself to program in HTML.  If I had to describe myself in one word, that word would be Curious, and my curiosity has taken me in many directions as you can see in this website.
<br>
Please check out my corporate experience which includes a two week internship in Manhattan working for Sansi Corporation but also exposure to the Orion Space Program at Lockeed Martin in Littleton, Co.  The interest section shows the many ways my passion for learning and projects have become an important part of my live, and I’m especially proud of my photography.
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to check this out.
<br>
Alex
